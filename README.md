- Hi, Iâ€™m @RRoten2004.

- My career focus is in creating and editing documentation.

- Every day, Iâ€™m learning more about Git, Markdown, GitHub Desktop, and studying cloud-based environments.

- I learned a lot about working in Visual Studio Code before deciding that GitHub Desktop is a lot friendlier.

- Markdown formatting offers incredible upsides and some limits. Learning to work within those limits, well, it's really cool.

- Maybe we can collaborate on cloud-based environment development.

- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: send your email address to me, thanks.
