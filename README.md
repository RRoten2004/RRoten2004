- Hi, Iâ€™m @RRoten2004.

- My career focus is and has been in creating and editing documentation.

- Every day, Iâ€™m learning more about Git, Markdown, GitHub Desktop, tools adjacent to all those, and studying cloud-based environments.

- I learned a lot about working in Visual Studio Code before deciding that, for the Git interactions part of what I was doing, GitHub Desktop is a lot friendlier. All you folks out there who are command-line wizards, I salute you.  **RECOGNIZE!**

- Markdown formatting offers incredible upsides and some limits. Learning to work within those limits, well, it's really cool.

- Maybe we can collaborate on cloud-based information development.

- ðŸ“«  *How to reach me:* please send your email address to me. Thanks.

Sincerest wishes to you for an agreeable day, with special hopes that your next meal exceeds all positive expectations.
